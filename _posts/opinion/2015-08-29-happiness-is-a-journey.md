For a long time, it seemed to me that life was about to begin a real life. 

But, there was always some obsacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business. 

Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment that you have and treasure in more because you share it with someone special, someone special, someone special enough to spend your time with. 

Make the most of your time. Don't waste too much of your time studying, working or stressing about something that seems important. 

Do what you want to do to be happy but also do what you can to make the people you care about happy.

Remember that time waits for no one. So stop waiting until you take your last test, until you finish school, until you go back to school, until you have the perfect body, the perfect cart, or whatever other perfect thing you desire.

Stop waiting until the weekend, when you can party ot let loose, until summer, spring, fall or winter, until you find the right person and get married, until you die, until your born again, to deside that there is no better time than right now to be happy.

Happiness is a journey, not a destination. So work like you don't need the money. Love like you have never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching.
