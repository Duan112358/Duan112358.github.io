title: Programmer Struggle.
description: life is a struggle.

The life of a programmer is mostly a never-ending struggle. 

Solving problems in an always-changing technical landscape means that programmers are always learning new things.

In this case, “learning new things” is a euphemism for “battling against our own ignorance.” 

Even if a programmer is just fixing a bug in code that uses a familiar technology, sometimes the software we create is so complex that simply understanding what is going on can take an entire day.
If you write code, you will struggle.

Most professional programmers learn to struggle hour after hour, day after day, without getting (too) frustrated.

This is another skill that will serve you well.
