This is my first post. 
Here I'd like to describe something about my emotion and desire on wirtting blogs.
Long before, I had make up my mind to write a post every week at least, just to sum up what I have learned or something valueable to be recorded.
You may had got what I want to say, it only last for one month, and I give up , maybe it couldn't be called as a habit at all.

But from now on, I get it back again, after a long period of deep thinking. This time is real, I do make up my mind, I told myself, no matter what you think about it.

Thanks [barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), the jekyll seed project give me a great favor on building my own blog.
